# Relay canonical consolidation status

**Canonical source consolidation PASS.** Canonical `main` was merged/pushed and its remote SHA verified. Fresh remote clone `0feb834594c9b25596653894333306d4770345a3` passes deterministic install, tests, types/governance, build and migration qualification. See [machine-readable receipt](CANONICAL-RECEIPT.json) and [fresh-canonical evidence](qualification/canonical-main/report.json).

Independent review PASS across all three repositories. MyEve: 1,896 application tests, 141 root tests, 15 builder tests; scope24, bridge9, Gate B25, Gate C47, connected CLI16, full recovery/Golden matrix and real A/B browser5 with4 accessibility audits PASS. Relay:450 tests,6 optional skips, performance2, migration26→29 and hosted required quality PASS. MyFactory:134 tests,1 opt-in skip, SQLite v6/v7→v8 and producer governance PASS.

The two-person ownership model is implemented: private by default, explicit business grants, bounded Work context, owner/service credentials and exact policy-bound decisions. The observed cross-owner disclosure, credential transfer, implicit promotion and authority-violation counters are zero in controlled qualification.

The controlled whole-product journey passes while Result/Proof correctly remains PARTIAL where publication, hosted verification or owner acceptance is absent. No real provider call or manual production deployment was made. Existing GitHub/Vercel automation produced Preview deployments; that is not live product acceptance.

Cleanup completed: 8 local branches removed and 4 stale registrations pruned. Verified private recovery bundles preserve pre-cleanup refs. Remote branches deleted:0. The exact remote manifest awaits final destructive approval after automatic approval review rejected the bulk deletion. Dirty primary checkouts remain unchanged; their local main refs were not rewritten. Other-chat managed worktrees, unique histories and inaccessible hosted checkouts remain protected. Task-owned integration checkouts may be retired after this final audit is pushed.
